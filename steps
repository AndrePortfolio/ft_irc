Pre-requisites:
1. understand the following external functions:
	socket, close, setsockopt, getsockname,
	getprotobyname, gethostbyname, getaddrinfo,
	freeaddrinfo, bind, connect, listen, accept, htons,
	htonl, ntohs, ntohl, inet_addr, inet_ntoa, send,
	recv, signal, sigaction, lseek, fstat, fcntl,
	poll(or equivalent) i.e select(), kqueue() or epool().

2. Understand concepts:
	- server
	- client
	- server-to-server communication
	- port
	- non-blocking I/O operations.
	- What are *operators* (in IRC context)
	- Receiving partial data
	- Low bandwith
	- what is "nc" (nc 127.0.0.1 6667)
	- What is the relationship between ctrl+D and ’com’, then ’man’, then ’d\n’
	- Aggregate packets and rebuilding them

3. clients:
	- Halloy (best)
	- irssi

Requirements:
1. The server must be capable of handling multiple clients
	at the same time and never hang.
2. Forking is not allowed. All I/O operations must be non-blocking
3. Only 1 pool() (or equivalent) can be used to handle all operations
	(read, write, but also listen and so forth).
4. You can't read/recv or write/send in any file descriptor without using
	pool() (or equivalent).
5. Choose 1 IRC client. Must connect to the server without encontering any error.
6. Communication between client and server has to be done via TCP/IP (v4 or v6)
7. Features to implement:
	1. Able to authenticate, set a nickname and username, join a channel,
		send and receive private messages using your reference cliente.
	2. All the messages sent from on client to a channel have to be forwarded
		to every other clienet that joined the channel.
	3. You must have *operators* and regular users.
	4. *operators* must have specific commands only they can use.
		- KICK: Eject an client from the channel.
		- INVITE: Invite a client to a channel.
		- TOPIC: Change or view the channel's mode.
		- MODE: Change the channel's mode:
			* i: Set/remove invite-only channel
			* t: Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to
				channel *operators*.
			* k: Set/remove the channel key(password).
			* o: Give/take channel operator privilege.
			* l: Set/remove the user limit to channel.


NOTE: for MacOS you are allowed to use fcntl() instead of write(), but
	only in the following format: fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);
NOTE: Use ctrl+D to send the command in several parts: ’com’, then ’man’
	then ’d\n’.
NOTE: In order to process a command, you have to first aggregate the received
	packets in order to rebuild it.

COMPARE TO natcat:
1. nc irc.libera.chat 6667
2. NICK YourNickname
3. USER YourUsername 0 * :Real Name
4. JOIN #libera

COMMON MISTAKES:
- Be careful to properly broadcast each event that other clients need to see
	(when someone joins/leaves a channel, if someone if kicked, or if the mode changes)
- JOIN #chan1,#chan2,#chan3 pass1,pass2
- What if username, nickname and realname were all different?
- Make sure to test the +k mode properly!
- Why do I have a @ prefixed to my nickname?
