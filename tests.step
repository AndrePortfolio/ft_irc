1. Setting Channel Modes (MODE command)
Invite-Only Mode (+i): Only users who have been invited can join the channel.

/MODE #channel +i
Expected Behavior: The channel is set to invite-only. If a user who is not invited tries to join the channel using /JOIN #channel, they will get the error message: Cannot join channel (+i).
Password Protection (+k): Set a password for the channel.

Copy code
/MODE #channel +k secretPassword
Expected Behavior: The channel is now password-protected. If another user attempts to join without the correct password (/JOIN #channel wrongPassword), they will get the error message: Cannot join channel (Incorrect password). Joining with /JOIN #channel secretPassword should allow entry.
User Limit (+l): Set a user limit for the channel.

/MODE #channel +l 2
Expected Behavior: The channel now has a user limit of 2. If a third user tries to join (/JOIN #channel), they will get the error message: Cannot join channel (Channel is full).
Remove Channel Modes (-i, -k, -l): To remove the modes set above.

/MODE #channel -i
/MODE #channel -k
/MODE #channel -l
Expected Behavior: Removing these modes should make the channel publicly joinable without a password and without a user limit.
